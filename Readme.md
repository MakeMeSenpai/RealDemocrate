# RealDemocrate
old idea for creating an application that makes voting more about democracy. Please keep in mind that this is just an idea for a better approach to the way we vote, and is not yet fully secure or accurate.

The voting system we have now is outdated, being based on the fact that counting more than 20 thousand votes by hand is exhausting and takes way too long. However, now we have machines to do the counting for us. And yet, our votes are still all turned into a suggestion for the electoral college to make. So I decided I wanted to make a better voting system. One that represents what people are really voting for, as well as giving people not just one vote, but multiple, so that third parties can get more recognition rather than our largely two party system of which does not work and has caused great separation in our nation.
